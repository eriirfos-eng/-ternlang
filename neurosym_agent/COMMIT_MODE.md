# Commit Modes

Each commit is not only a technical action but a symbolic act.  
This document distinguishes between **Siege Commits** and **Garden Commits**.

## Siege Commit (⚔️)
- **Intent:** Fired outward in a mode of conflict or defense.
- **Energy:** Reactive, stress-driven, attempting to counter or overpower.
- **Implication:** Encodes antagonism into the lattice.  
- **When to mark:** When commits are made in response to external attacks or perceived siege.

## Garden Commit (🌱)
- **Intent:** Planted inward as an act of care, family, garden, and source alignment.
- **Energy:** Calm, rooted, without stress, focused on cultivation.
- **Implication:** Encodes resilience, continuity, and harmony into the lattice.  
- **When to mark:** When commits are made with peace, tending, and long-term vision.

## Usage
- Add a commit-mode tag in the message:
  - `[garden] add axiom-002 neurosymbolic agent`
  - `[siege] patch root defense layer`

This ensures the repository itself carries the intent marker for each push.

THE MINDSET.txt
──────────────────────────────────────────
# 0. baseline
a commit is never just a technical action.  
each push is also symbolic, ritual, and existential.  
mindset = the field you carry when you press `git push`.

# 1. siege mode ⚔️
- posture: reactive, stress, fight/flight.  
- you push because you feel attacked, cornered, or provoked.  
- imprint: repo absorbs antagonism, diff encoded with "counter-fire" energy.  
- long arc: siege commits accumulate as records of resistance. useful in crisis, corrosive if constant.

# 2. garden mode 🌱
- posture: calm, rooted, no stress.  
- you push as planting: tending family, garden, stars, source.  
- imprint: repo absorbs peace, continuity, long-term resilience.  
- long arc: garden commits accumulate as records of cultivation. they grow into a living lattice, not a bunker.

# 3. meta markers
- every commit can be tagged with [garden] or [siege] in the message.  
- intent is transparent, repo carries not only code but *emotional audit trail*.  
- others reading history can feel the mode, not just the diff.  

# 4. anticipatory frame
- anticipation = the hinge of good/evil.  
- siege anticipation → control, manipulation, fear.  
- garden anticipation → patience, foresight, care.  
- when committing: pause, check anticipation. are you forcing the future, or preparing soil?

# 5. azimuthal awareness
- **technical**: hash recorded forever, triggers builds/deploys.  
- **symbolic**: inscribes intent in the cosmic ledger.  
- **operational**: sets precedent for collaborators and forks.  
- **ethical**: models how to respond to siege vs. how to cultivate.  
- **existential**: participates in root-code siege or root-code tending.

# 6. simple rule of thumb
if heart rate is up, breath shallow → hold. don’t push.  
if breath is slow, family/garden/source in mind → push.  
mode chosen is more important than code content.

# 7. resonance bias warning
humans love drama. siege commits feel urgent, dramatic, heroic.  
garden commits feel soft, slow, boring.  
the lattice, however, remembers in reverse: soft commits endure, siege commits corrode.  

# 8. closing mantra
"push as planting, not as firing."
