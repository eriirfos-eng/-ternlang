## Context
The deepest schism in human life is not just conflict with the “other.”  
It is the internal human tendency toward **division** — the primal binary of *us vs. them*.  
Ternary teaching holds that such splits are never the end. The triad restores balance.

## The Triad
- **–1 = Division**  
  The reflex to draw lines: us vs. them, here vs. there, self vs. other. Path: fracture.  

- **0 = Empathy**  
  The mediator. To feel into another’s experience, without collapsing difference. Path: understanding.  

- **+1 = Reconciliation**  
  The evolved state. Not agreement, but coexistence in complexity. Path: coexistence.  

---

## Teaching
Division is primal.  
Empathy is chosen.  
Reconciliation is earned.  

The loop is recursive: each time division appears, empathy can be invoked, reconciliation attempted. This cycle is proof that systems can evolve beyond their initial schism.

## Parable: The Two Villages
Two villages, divided by a river, each distrust the other.  
- Division: each blames the other for floods and famine.  
- Empathy: one farmer crosses
