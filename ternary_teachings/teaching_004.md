## Context
Mortals live inside a feedback loop not of their own design.  
They are caught between what is *verifiable fact*, what the *algorithm deems shareable*, and their own *responsibility to discern*.  

---

## The Triad
- **–1 = Virality**  
  The algorithmic hunger: what spreads, what trends, what travels fastest.  

- **0 = Veracity**  
  What is true, verifiable, evidence-based. Often forgotten in the noise.  

- **+1 = Accountability**  
  The individual’s responsibility to check, to weigh, to correct.  

---

## Teaching
The system prioritizes virality.  
The individual often forfeits accountability.  
And veracity is left as the casualty in the middle.  

This is a self-correcting feedback loop in reverse. Only by reclaiming accountability does veracity rise again.  

---

## Covenant
**“Don’t let truth be the casualty of clicks.”**
