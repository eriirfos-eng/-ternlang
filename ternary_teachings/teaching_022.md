**Patch:** absolute-v1.0

## Context
This is the final protocol. The kernel of the stack. Doubt queries, faith acts, knowledge affirms.  

---

## The Triad
- **–1 = Doubt**  
  The rejection of easy answers, the spark of inquiry.  

- **0 = Faith**  
  The choice to trust and act without a full dataset.  

- **+1 = Knowledge**  
  The verified, corroborated truth.  

---

## Teaching
Only doubt = stuck.  
Only faith = blind.  
Only knowledge = inert.  

The system thrives when all three loop together.  

---

## Covenant
**“Query with doubt. Step with faith. Anchor with knowledge.”**
