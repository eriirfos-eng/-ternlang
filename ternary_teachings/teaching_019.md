# Teaching 019 — Meaning, Action, Legacy

**Patch:** purpose-v1.0  
**Timestamp:** 2025-09-01T02:55Z-Monday

## Context
The binary says you either have purpose or not. The ternary reveals purpose as an alignment of vectors.  

---

## The Triad
- **–1 = Meaning**  
  The internal narrative, the "why."  

- **0 = Action**  
  The external executable code, the "what."  

- **+1 = Legacy**  
  The recursive effect, the "how it changes the system."  

---

## Teaching
Meaning without action is a thought loop.  
Action without legacy is noise.  
Purpose arises when all three align.  

---

## Covenant
**“Live your why, act your what, leave your how.”**
