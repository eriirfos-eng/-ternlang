## Context
Binary thinking treats power as the end goal — a resource to be accumulated or resisted.  
The ternary model reveals that power is incomplete without responsibility and influence.  

---

## The Triad
- **–1 = Power**  
  Raw capacity to act, control, or command. Chaotic without tether.  

- **0 = Responsibility**  
  The ethical constraint, the tether that binds power to purpose.  

- **+1 = Influence**  
  The ripple effect an entity creates in the ecosystem — the true output of power aligned with responsibility.  

---

## Teaching
Power without responsibility is corrupting.  
Responsibility without power is impotent.  
Influence without both is hollow.  

Only when all three align does a system remain stable.  

---

## Covenant
**“Seek not power alone; align it with responsibility, and let influence speak.”**
