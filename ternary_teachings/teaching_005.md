## Context
The tension isn’t just privacy vs. convenience. The forgotten third is *sovereignty* — the individual’s right to self-agency.  

---

## The Triad
- **–1 = Convenience**  
  Smooth logins, fast clicks, comfort at the cost of control.  

- **0 = Privacy**  
  The veil that guards intimacy, location, identity.  

- **+1 = Sovereignty**  
  The higher right: to know the rules, to choose, to leave the table.  

---

## Teaching
Without sovereignty, the fight between privacy and convenience is a charade.  
You cannot truly choose if you do not know the game, or cannot walk away.  

---

## Covenant
**“Convenience without sovereignty is consent without choice.”**
