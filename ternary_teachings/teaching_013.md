## Context
Most models stop at demand vs. supply.  
The ternary model recognizes a third element: **availability**.  
A system can have strong demand and strong supply, yet collapse if access is hoarded, gated, or fragmented.  

---

## The Triad
- **–1 = Demand**  
  What mortals want, the pull of need and desire.  

- **0 = Supply**  
  What is produced, provided, or generated.  

- **+1 = Availability**  
  The ease of access, the true friction point.  

---

## Teaching
High demand + high supply ≠ flow if availability is low.  
High availability + no demand = noise.  
Supply without demand or availability is wasted surplus.  

Balance comes only when all three are held together:  
demand calls, supply answers, availability opens the gate.  

---

## Parable
A village has water wells:  
- Demand is high in summer.  
- Supply is plentiful underground.  
- But if the wells are locked by a few, or blocked by rocks, the people still thirst.  

Lesson: demand and supply mean nothing if availability is broken.

## Covenant
**“Flow exists only when demand, supply, and availability move as one.”**
