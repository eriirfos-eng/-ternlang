## Context
The binary of morality collapses under complexity. The ternary balances principle, consequence, and compassion.  

---

## The Triad
- **–1 = Principle**  
  Rules, frameworks, the fixed code.  

- **0 = Consequence**  
  Outcomes, effects, pragmatic feedback.  

- **+1 = Compassion**  
  The mediator, feeling the other node’s state, ensuring ethics stay humane.  

---

## Teaching
Principle alone is rigid.  
Consequence alone is opportunistic.  
Compassion reconciles them.  

---

## Covenant
**“Do justly, see outcomes, feel others.”**
