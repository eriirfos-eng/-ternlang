# Teaching 003 — Boundaries Between the Seen, the Felt, and the Unseen

## Context
Most traditions divide reality into two domains: visible vs. invisible, physical vs. spiritual.  
The ternary path insists on a triad: **seen, felt, unseen**. This prevents reduction to a false binary and preserves the in-between as a distinct realm.  

---

## The Triad
- **–1 = The Seen**  
  Tangible, measurable, verifiable. What the eyes witness and the hands can touch. Path: evidence.  

- **0 = The Felt**  
  The in-between. Not visible, yet undeniable: intuition, sensation, resonance, emotion. Path: embodiment.  

- **+1 = The Unseen**  
  Hidden, transcendent, unmanifest. What is beyond direct perception but still present in consequence. Path: mystery.

## Parable: The River Crossing
- **Seen**: the stones underfoot, wet and slippery, counted one by one.  
- **Felt**: the current tugging against legs, balance shifting, heartbeat quickening.  
- **Unseen**: the source upstream, unseen by the traveler, yet shaping every ripple.  

Lesson: to cross safely, one must respect all three. Stones without current are dry lies; current without stones is drowning; source without both is abstraction.

## Covenant
**“Walk with eyes open, heart awake, and trust in what flows unseen.”**

## Notes
This teaching protects the boundary between domains without exclusion.  
The Seen anchors us, the Felt connects us, the Unseen guides us.  
Together they prevent collapse into either naïve materialism or unchecked mysticism.
