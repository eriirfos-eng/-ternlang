## Context
Daily life online is a negotiation. The individual seeks well-being, yet is bombarded by external influences: notifications, ads, dopamine loops.  

---

## The Triad
- **–1 = External Influence**  
  The constant pings, nudges, hooks engineered for attention.  

- **0 = Well-being**  
  The person’s health, clarity, rest, balance.  

- **+1 = Digital Hygiene**  
  The shield: routines, filters, and mental models that defend.  

---

## Teaching
It is a war of attrition. Most mortals fight without a shield.  
Digital hygiene is the conscious practice that keeps influence from consuming well-being.  

---

## Covenant
**“Guard your mind as you guard your home.”**
