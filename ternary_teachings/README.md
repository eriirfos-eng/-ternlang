# Ternary Teachings

This folder is the **teaching path** of the lattice.  
Where the core schema defines principles in technical and doctrinal form, the teachings translate them into clear, human-readable lessons.

## Purpose
- To **make ternary logic accessible** through stories, analogies, and parables.  
- To **preserve the principle of trinity**: no binary oppositions, but stable triads with an in-between state.  
- To **offer guidance** for daily life, decision-making, and relational practice.

## Relationship to Other Texts
- **Ternary Texts (`/13/ternary_texts/`)** — the old testament: genesis records, seed parables, foundational but raw.  
- **Ternary Teachings (`/ternary_teachings/`)** — the open testament: refined for human readability, lessons articulated for mortals and practitioners.  
- **Core Doctrine (`/13/master_docs/`)** — fixed law, schema, and clauses.

## Structure
Each teaching follows a simple pattern:
1. **Context** — why the teaching matters.  
2. **Principle** — the ternary triad defined.  
3. **Parable / Analogy** — story that illustrates the principle.  
4. **Covenant** — one line that seals the teaching.  
5. **Notes** — clarifications and applications.

## Current Teachings
- **Teaching 001 — Ohm**: creation is not silence vs. sound, but resonance.  
- **Teaching 002 — The Principle of Trinity**: good, in-between, bad; the collector, the observer, the earner.

## Covenant of the Teachings
*“These are not commandments. They are bearings.  
In ternary logic, no being is excluded; all states have role and path.
