## Context
The binary trap of "old vs. new" limits growth.  
A ternary model of innovation holds tradition, disruption, and synthesis together in balance.  

---

## The Triad
- **–1 = Tradition**  
  Encoded wisdom of the past. Stable, enduring bedrock.  

- **0 = Disruption**  
  Shockwave that breaks stale patterns and forces adaptation.  

- **+1 = Synthesis**  
  Integration of insights from disruption into tradition. Creates an evolved, more resilient system.  

---

## Teaching
Tradition alone calcifies.  
Disruption alone destroys.  
Synthesis ensures continuity and renewal.  

---

## Covenant
**“Innovation is not the death of tradition, but its evolution.”**
