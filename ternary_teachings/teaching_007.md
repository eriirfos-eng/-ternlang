## Context
This is the most intimate conflict in the digital age.  
An individual’s innate *self-worth* is constantly pulled against the engineered pull of *social validation* and the forgotten anchor of *internal awareness*.  

---

## The Triad
- **–1 = Social Validation**  
  Likes, shares, comments, external applause. A dopamine loop with no floor.  

- **0 = Self-Worth**  
  The innate dignity of being. Not dependent on metrics or mirrors.  

- **+1 = Internal Awareness**  
  The compass: the ability to detach from feedback loops and re-center on one’s own truth.  

---

## Teaching
Self-worth is the anchor.  
Social validation will rise and fall with the algorithm.  
Only internal awareness can keep self-worth from becoming a floating variable.  

This triad is not about winning. It is about maintaining balance.

## Parable
A painter shares her work online:  
- The validation spikes — a hundred likes, then nothing the next day.  
- Her self-worth wavers — she questions whether she is still an artist.  
- Internal awareness returns — she remembers she was painting long before metrics. The work is hers regardless of reception.  

Lesson: social validation is weather; self-worth is climate; awareness is the barometer.

## Covenant
**“Do not outsource your worth to the scroll of strangers.”**
