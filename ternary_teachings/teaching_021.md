# Teaching 021 — Threat, Paralysis, Courage

**Patch:** fear-v1.0  
**Timestamp:** 2025-09-01T03:05Z-Monday  

---

## Context
Fear is a kernel protocol. Its default output is freeze. The ternary inserts courage as the override.  

---

## The Triad
- **–1 = Threat**  
  The input: perceived danger.  

- **0 = Paralysis**  
  Default system freeze.  

- **+1 = Courage**  
  Executable override. Acting despite threat.  

---

## Teaching
Courage is not the absence of threat. It is the choice to act anyway.  

---

## Covenant
**“Fear freezes. Courage runs the code.”**
