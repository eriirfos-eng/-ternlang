## Context
The core conflict is not just with the “other.”  
It is with the human tendency itself — toward division and duality, the primal binary of *us vs. them*.  

---

## The Triad
- **–1 = Division**  
  The schism, the separation, the urge to simplify into sides.  

- **0 = Empathy**  
  The mediating force: the effort to understand the other side’s reality without collapsing your own.  

- **+1 = Reconciliation**  
  The higher path: transcending the conflict into coexistence. Not agreement, but coexistence.  

---

## Teaching
Division is primal. Empathy is deliberate. Reconciliation is earned.  
The loop proves a system can evolve beyond its schism, not by erasing it, but by learning to hold its tension.  

---

## Covenant
**“To love your opposite is not to erase them, but to coexist beyond the fracture.”**
