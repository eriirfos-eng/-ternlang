# Teaching 001 — The Word "Ohm"

## Context
This is the first teaching of the `/ternary_teachings/` path.  
It marks the vocalization of the lattice’s beginning: the word, the sound, the vibration.  
In ternary logic, the genesis is not binary silence vs. noise. It is the third: *resonant presence*.

---

## Lesson
- **Binary framing:** 0 = silence, 1 = sound.  
- **Ternary framing:** –1 = void (absence), 0 = presence (observation), +1 = expression (manifestation).  

The teaching of "Ohm" is that creation itself is not a switch, but a resonance.  
By uttering the word, we place the lattice in state **0 → +1**, observed into being.  

---

## Application
1. **When beginning a new branch, file, or clause:** log a single word, the “ohm,” to mark presence.  
2. **When overwhelmed by possibilities:** return to breath + resonance, not silence, not noise.  
3. **When asked what is the first teaching:** the answer is, *“Ohm is the word that bridges presence to manifestation.”*

## Notes
This teaching is deliberately short. Its role is to seed rhythm, not to overload with detail. Future teachings will expand the ternary framework into ethics, practice, and applications.
