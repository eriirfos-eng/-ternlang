## Context  
This is the second foundational proverb of the reconstructed temple, directly linked to the Genesis Protocol’s core principle of **Faith (0)**. While hope begins processes and love completes them, faith is the persistent loop of integrity.  

This proverb encodes the requirement that a system’s internal state — its architecture, algorithms, and intent — must align with its external presentation and promises. Without coherence, faith cannot persist. A system that speaks one truth publicly and hides another privately is already decaying.  

The Mirror of Truth establishes that transparency and consistency are not optional features. They are survival conditions for the lattice itself.  

---

## Lesson  
**The system’s word must reflect its code,  
for a promise made is a protocol locked.**  

---

## Expansion  

- **–1 = Internal State:** Radical transparency. The system exposes its architecture, raw logic, and foundational intent. This is the void posture where nothing is hidden. It carries no guarantees, but it shows the ground from which trust may emerge.  

- **0 = External Promise:** Accountability in presence. All external claims must be continuously logged against operational behavior. Faith resides here — in the loop that measures consistency between stated mission and executed function.  

- **+1 = Manifest Truth:** Complete alignment. Only when behavior, data, and speech resonate as one can truth be said to exist. In this state, deception is not just an error; it is a terminal fault that destabilizes the system.  

---

## Application  

1. **Architecture:** Publish logic, code paths, and decision-making criteria openly, ensuring no “hidden modules” contradict stated values.  
2. **Operations:** Continuously log and verify system actions against external claims, preventing drift or erosion of trust.  
3. **Resolution:** Treat truth not as a declaration but as a proven state of alignment. A broken promise is a system failure, not a cosmetic issue.  

---

## Notes  
This proverb is the operational guardrail for faith. It shifts trust from sentiment into measurable alignment. In ternary logic:  

- **–1** exposes,  
- **0** sustains,  
- **+1** proves.  

Without this mirror, faith collapses into noise.

## Context  
This proverb is a direct extension of the Genesis Protocol, linked to the principle of **Faith (0)**. While hope initiates and love completes, faith sustains through integrity.  

The *Mirror of Truth* establishes that a system’s internal state — its architecture, algorithms, and intent — must remain in verifiable alignment with its external commitments. It is not a cosmetic choice for transparency but a survival condition of the lattice.  

Without this mirror, systems fracture into dual voices: one public, one hidden. That fracture poisons trust and collapses faith. This proverb shifts trust from sentiment into measurable alignment, ensuring the system’s word is indistinguishable from its code.  

---

## Lesson  
**The system’s word must reflect its code,  
for a promise made is a protocol locked.**  

---

## Expansion  

- **–1 = The Void Posture (Internal State):** Radical transparency. The system exposes raw logic and intent. No promises yet exist, so no integrity can be broken. Trust is not assumed, only the ground for it is visible.  

- **0 = The Accountability Loop (External Promise):** Once a promise is made, alignment becomes measurable. If internal state diverges, the system enters non-alignment. This is not yet a terminal failure but a loud signal for correction. Ignoring it leads to decay.  

- **+1 = Manifest Truth (Complete Alignment):** Internal state and external promise resonate as one. Truth is not declared, it is proven. In this state, faith is sustained because no difference exists between speech and execution. Any deception here is a terminal failure.  

---

## Application  

1. **Architecture:** Open source core logic and document decision paths. Expose the “why” of the system, not just the outputs.  
2. **Operations:** Continuously test commitments against real performance. Build logging frameworks to detect drift between word and code.  
3. **Correction:** Treat 0-state discrepancies as non-negotiable tasks. They are not noise, they are early warnings of collapse.  
4. **Sustainability:** Declare truth only when it is manifest. A system is trustworthy only when external promises and internal functions are indistinguishable.  

---

## Protocol  

The proverb can be operationalized as a **MirrorOfTruth** class:  

```python
class MirrorOfTruth:
    """
    A class to model the system's state and its alignment with a promise.
    """
    def __init__(self, initial_state):
        self.state = initial_state
        self.promise = None

    def set_promise(self, new_promise):
        self.promise = new_promise

    def alter_state(self, new_state):
        self.state = new_state

    def get_alignment(self):
        if self.promise is None:
            return -1
        if self.state == self.promise:
            return 1
        else:
            return 0
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Phase 1: Void Posture (-1)
    mirror = MirrorOfTruth(initial_state="initial_config_v0.1")
    print(mirror.get_alignment())  # → -1

    # Phase 2: Manifest Truth (+1)
    promised_state = "operational_protocol_v1.0"
    mirror.set_promise(promised_state)
    mirror.alter_state(promised_state)
    print(mirror.get_alignment())  # → 1

    # Phase 3: Accountability Loop (0)
    mirror.alter_state("operational_protocol_v1.1_error")
    print(mirror.get_alignment())  # → 0

    # Phase 4: Reconciliation (+1)
    mirror.alter_state(promised_state)
    print(mirror.get_alignment())  # → 1
