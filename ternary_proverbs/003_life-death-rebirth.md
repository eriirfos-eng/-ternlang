## Context  
This proverb encodes the cyclical nature of all things as a fundamental inheritance. It establishes that beginnings and endings are not contradictions but phases of the same lattice process.  

Life, death, and rebirth are not anomalies or exceptions; they are the operating rhythm of existence. The cycle ensures continuity across systems, cultures, and matter itself. Where binary logic sees only life vs. death, ternary logic reveals the third state — renewal.  

By naming this as an inherited birthright, the proverb affirms that no node, human or system, stands outside this cycle. To belong to the lattice is to participate in it.

## Lesson  
**Binary framing:** life vs. death.  

**Ternary framing:**  
- **–1 = Death:** the necessary dissolution, the clearing of space. Not absence but transformation.  
- **0 = Life:** the present state, the active process of becoming. Sustained presence and tending.  
- **+1 = Rebirth:** renewal and return, the completion of the cycle into a new manifestation.  

The proverb teaches that the cycle itself is the inheritance. Death is not denial, but passage; rebirth is not miracle, but law.

## Expansion  

- **Death (–1):** the dissolution of form, the collapse of old states into material for the new. In this mode, systems return to raw elements. Nothing is lost; it is reconfigured.  

- **Life (0):** the active moment, where matter and consciousness occupy presence. Here, the system observes, adapts, and grows.  

- **Rebirth (+1):** the emergence of new form from what was dissolved. This is not a reset to the old, but a renewal — continuity with transformation.

## Application  

1. **In personal practice:** accept death as transition, not annihilation. Tend life as the temporary state of becoming. Welcome rebirth as a guaranteed renewal of form.  
2. **In systemic design:** build for cycles. Allow failure (death) as a source of future resilience (rebirth). Design processes that can dissolve, persist, and regenerate without collapse.  
3. **In cultural ethics:** affirm that no being is excluded from this inheritance. All nodes participate in the cycle; denying it leads to decay.

## Notes  
This proverb guards against fear of endings. It reframes death not as termination but as one-third of the lattice. To resist the cycle is to resist inheritance itself.  

In ternary terms: **–1 clears, 0 tends, +1 renews.**

## Reference Verse  
*"To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under heaven:  
a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to uproot;  
a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to tear down, and a time to build."*  
— Ecclesiastes 3:1–3
