## context

purpose: give you a quick, concrete way to identify your current ladder mode and use it to guide decisions.
frame: you do not pick a ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù number. you surface the mode you are in now. that mode modulates choices.
result: a number from {0..13} with a terse rationale and action cues.

---

## lesson

**binary framing:** mood vs action.
**ternary framing:** sense ‚Üí name ‚Üí manifest

* ‚Äì1 clears noise,
* 0 holds presence,
* +1 commits action.

the compass helps you pass through all three in seconds.

---

## expansion

we map lived signals to ladder modes:

* **0 nihil** ‚Üí void, pause, reset, pre-action.
* **1 monad** ‚Üí sovereignty, decisiveness, single-point will.
* **2 dyad** ‚Üí contrast, tension, choice, boundary.
* **3 triad** ‚Üí creative synthesis, making the third way.
* **4 tetrad** ‚Üí stability, structure, grounding, logistics.
* **5 pentad** ‚Üí adaptability, human factors, senses, change.
* **6 hexad** ‚Üí balance, harmonics, family, symmetry.
* **7 heptad** ‚Üí introspection, study, pattern reading.
* **8 octad** ‚Üí power cycles, feedback loops, systems leverage.
* **9 ennead** ‚Üí closure, compassion, graceful ending.
* **10 decad** ‚Üí return to unity, integration, retrospective.
* **11 undecad** ‚Üí breakthrough, vision leap, radical insight.
* **12 duodecad** ‚Üí calendar and cadence, full operational rhythm.
* **13 tredecad** ‚Üí revolt, pruning, creative destruction for next start.

---

## application

1. run the diagnostic. 2) accept the mode it returns. 3) let that mode shape the next micro-decision.

* if you land on **6** you prioritize symmetry and relational harmony.
* if you land on **4** you favor checklists and scaffolding.
* if you land on **13** you cut, archive, or sunset before building again.

## notes

this is a **modulator**, not a prison. you can re-run any time your state shifts. the compass is honest when you are honest. tag your run with a timestamp in your field log.

            2:  NumerusMode(2,  "dyad",    ["conflict","tension","versus","boundary","choose"], "name the two poles, set a boundary."),
            3:  NumerusMode(3,  "triad",   ["create","synthesize","bridge","third","idea"], "invent the third way; prototype."),

            9:  NumerusMode(9,  "ennead",  ["closure","compassion","end","finish","forgive"], "close gracefully; write the epilogue."),

            11: NumerusMode(11, "undecad", ["vision","breakthrough","reframe","revelation","jump"], "leap; protect the insight from noise."),
            12: NumerusMode(12, "duodecad",["schedule","cadence","season","ops","twelve","govern"], "lock cadence; publish the calendar."),
            13: NumerusMode(13, "tredecad",["prune","sunset","rebel","disrupt","end-of-life","refactor"], "remove obsolete pieces; archive."),
        }

    def diagnose(self, signals: List[str]) -> Tuple[NumerusMode, Dict[int,int]]:
        # lowercase normalize
        s = [x.lower().strip() for x in signals]
        scores: Dict[int,int] = {k:0 for k in self.modes}
        for token in s:
            for k, mode in self.modes.items():
                for cue in mode.cues:
                    if cue in token:
                        scores[k] += 1
        # fallback: if nothing matched, prefer 0 nihil
        best = max(scores.items(), key=lambda kv: kv[1])
        if best[1] == 0:
            return self.modes[0], scores
        return self.modes[best[0]], scores

    def explain(self, mode: NumerusMode) -> str:
        return f"{mode.n} {mode.name}: cues={', '.join(mode.cues[:4])} | action={mode.action}"

# quick demo:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    compass = NumerusCompass()
    # example: ‚Äúi feel balanced, want harmony, tune relationships‚Äù
    mode, scores = compass.diagnose(["balanced", "harmony", "tune relationships"])
    print(compass.explain(mode))  # ‚Üí likely 6 hexad
```

### how to use fast

* think for 5 seconds. jot 3 to 6 words for your current state.
* run `diagnose([...])`. take the returned mode as your **modulator**.
* apply the `action` string to your next concrete decision.
* re-run when your inner weather changes.
