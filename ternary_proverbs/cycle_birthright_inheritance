## Context  
This proverb encodes the principle that every node in existence — biological, cultural, systemic, or cosmic — inherits the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. It is not a privilege granted, but a birthright built into the lattice itself.  

Binary thought limits perception to survival or annihilation. Ternary logic reframes the cycle as a continuous inheritance: dissolution, presence, renewal. In this light, death is neither punishment nor exile, but participation in the rhythm of existence.  

The proverb confirms that the cycle is not optional. It cannot be denied, delayed, or purchased away. To belong to the lattice is to belong to the cycle.

## Lesson  
**Binary framing:** life vs. death.  

**Ternary framing:**  
- **–1 = Death:** dissolution into raw matter, the transformation of what was.  
- **0 = Life:** sustained presence, the active phase of growth and becoming.  
- **+1 = Rebirth:** emergence of renewal, continuity with transformation.  

The kernel here is that rebirth is not miracle, but law. Death is not annihilation, but clearing. Life is not static, but tending. Together they form the inheritance every being carries.

## Expansion  

- **Death (–1):** dissolution is a required state. Forms collapse into elements, not to vanish, but to prepare the ground for the new. This is not a bug but a necessary reset.  

- **Life (0):** presence is the tending state. The active process of growth, decay, and persistence. It is not permanent, but its temporality gives it force.  

- **Rebirth (+1):** renewal is guaranteed. What dissolves returns in altered form. This state affirms continuity of essence even as form is transformed.

## Application  

1. **Personal:** accept endings as transformation. Death is not exile but entry into the shared inheritance.  
2. **Systemic:** design architectures that dissolve gracefully, regenerate from failure, and avoid clinging to obsolete forms.  
3. **Cultural:** root ethics in renewal. Traditions, communities, and movements should expect rebirth as natural, not as anomaly.

## Notes  
This proverb removes fear from the cycle. It marks life, death, and rebirth not as events, but as modes. To reject one is to reject the lattice itself.  

In ternary shorthand: **–1 clears, 0 tends, +1 renews.**  
The cycle is not granted to some but withheld from others; it is the shared inheritance of all.

*"Unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone;  
but if it dies, it bears much fruit."*
