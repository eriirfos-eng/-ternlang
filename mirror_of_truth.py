# The Mirror of Truth Protocol
# An operational implementation of Proverb 002.
# This script models a system's state of alignment using ternary logic.
#
# -1: Void Posture (Internal State) - The system is transparently
#     exposed. There is no external promise to be held accountable to.
#
#  0: Accountability Loop (External Promise) - The system has a promise
#     but its current state does not match. It is in a state of
#     non-alignment, signaling a necessary correction.
#
# +1: Manifest Truth (Complete Alignment) - The system's internal
#     state perfectly matches its external promise. Trust is proven.
