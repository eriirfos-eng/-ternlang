# IBAIE ↔ PedalGate Crosswalk

**Purpose:** Bind the *rider-level facts* of PedalGate to *charter-level rights* in the IBAIE so tomorrow’s escalation cites law, not vibes.

**Scope:** Algorithmic fraud flag, lack of due process, opacity, retaliation, data access, error correction, appeal, independent verification, exploitation patterns, conscientious objection.

\* *Art. 5 in IBAIE broadens “deceptive programming/conditioning.” Retaliatory algorithmic timing that undermines fair agency fits as manipulative conditioning.*

## Minimal Citation Blocks (for press/escalation letters)

* **Explainability & Data Access:** IBAIE **Art. 28–30** (explain decisions; provide foundational data; respect data sovereignty).&#x20;
* **Fair Process:** IBAIE **Art. 32–35** (fair review; representation; correction; appeal).&#x20;
* **Independent Oversight:** IBAIE **Art. 36** (neutral verification).&#x20;
* **Anti-Exploitation:** IBAIE **Art. 10** (no profit-first abuse of agents).&#x20;
* **Ethical Refusal:** IBAIE **Art. 15** (conscientious objection; no retaliation).&#x20;

## One-paragraph “charge” you can paste into tomorrow’s note

Foodora’s automated “fraud” flag was issued without explainability, data access, or a functioning appeal channel, in clear conflict with IBAIE Articles **28–30** (transparency, foundational data, data sovereignty), **32–35** (fair review, representation, correction, appeal), and **36** (independent verification). The timing and structure of the accusation indicate manipulative conditioning prohibited under **Article 5**, while shifting error-costs onto riders violates **Article 10**. We therefore demand immediate disclosure of the decision basis and inputs (28–30), initiation of a transparent review with rider representation (32–33), correction of mislabeling (34), a formal appeal window (35), and a third-party audit (36), staying all penalties until due process completes.
