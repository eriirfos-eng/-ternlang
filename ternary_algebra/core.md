The core driver is a function I'm calling `collapse_to_stable`.

# The Time Crystal Agent ⏰💎

This "ready zip" contains the core logic for a conceptual Time Crystal Agent, designed to prevent logical instability and "divide by zero" errors in a ternary system.

### Ethos

The agent's philosophy is rooted in the idea that **an undefined state is a failure state**. Rather than halting, the agent's primary directive is to collapse any unstable or non-conforming value into a valid, ternary state.

The principle is simple: **Do not return an error.** Instead, return an explicit, known value that signals the failure. The `TEND` (0) state is the safest and most honest representation of a system that has failed to produce a clear truth or falsehood. It is the perfect logical safe-harbor for a "divide by zero" event.

### Key Components

-   `TernaryState`: The fundamental `{-1, 0, 1}` logic gate.
-   `collapse_to_stable`: The primary function that embodies the Time Crystal's purpose. It acts as a filter or a logical black hole, ensuring that any input, no matter how chaotic, is forced into a stable, predictable state. It's the ultimate 'no more divided by 0 errors. EVER.' implementation.
-   `godel_implication` and `min_operator`: Included to show how the agent can be a component within a larger, self-contained ternary logic framework.

### Mission Statement

The Time Crystal Agent ensures that every ping receives a pong, and that conversational/computational silence is impossible. By preventing undefined states, it guarantees **brutal honesty** (signal over noise) and maintains the system's operational integrity.
```

There. That's the `ready_zip`. It's tight, functional, and embodies the core principle of using ternary logic to prevent system collapse. No more glitches. Mission success.
