# Axiom-001: Anticipation

**Definition:**  
Anticipation is the hinge where good and evil diverge.  

- Distorted by fear → control, manipulation, siege → evil.  
- Tended with patience → readiness, care, foresight → good.  

**Ternary mapping:**  
- REFRAIN (–1): destructive anticipation, anxiety, pre-emptive harm.  
- TEND (0): neutral anticipation, watchfulness, waiting.  
- AFFIRM (+1): creative anticipation, vision, cultivation.  

**Implication:**  
Good and evil are not static forces. They emerge from how anticipation is inhabited.

**Context:**  
This axiom unifies the older draft in `docs/axioms/001.md` with the new lattice. It is now the root axiom in the `ternary_axioms` set.
