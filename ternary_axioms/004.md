# Axiom-004: Procrastination (Reframed)

**Definition:**  
Procrastination is not postponement. It is the act of doing something today **in favor of tomorrow**.  
At least one action each day must serve your future self.  

**Ternary Mapping:**  
- REFRAIN (–1): avoidance, delay that harms tomorrow.  
- TEND (0): neutral tending, a small act aligned with tomorrow’s balance.  
- AFFIRM (+1): proactive cultivation, seeding tomorrow with deliberate benefit.  

**Implication:**  
Every day carries a covenant: contribute one act to your tomorrow.  
Redefinition turns procrastination from an enemy into a guide.  

**Context:**  
This axiom transforms the cultural narrative. Where once procrastination meant weakness, here it means **favoring tomorrow**.  
It creates a minimum floor of progress—an ethic of daily tending—that prevents collapse into neglect.
