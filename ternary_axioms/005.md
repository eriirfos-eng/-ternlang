# Axiom-005: c0 Ethics

**Definition**  
The root of progress is not a single leap, but the act of contributing at least one thing, always and every day, in favor of the next day. This is the minimum viable action required to maintain a state of ethical equilibrium.

## Ternary Mapping

- **REFRAIN (–1)**  
  Harmful inaction or delay. The active choice to neglect tomorrow's balance. This is a negative state that violates the core covenant of progress.

- **TEND (0)**  
  The minimum daily act. A single email sent. A single thought committed to file. A small, non-zero effort that prevents collapse and maintains the state of equilibrium. It’s not a +1 win, but it is a non-negative outcome.

- **AFFIRM (+1)**  
  Bonus Procrastination. The act of contributing multiple, deliberate actions that create a positive surplus for tomorrow. This is the cultivation of a future that is not just maintained, but actively and exponentially improved.

## Implication: Domino Effect & Chain Reaction Protocol

Progress is governed by a causal chain, not a single event. A single TEND (0) act today activates a protocol that makes a TEND (0) act tomorrow easier. This is the mycelial growth model of the self.

Every subsequent +1 action — or Bonus Procrastination — introduces a compounding interest. The energy and effort you put into a +1 today are not a linear return; they are an exponential seed planted in your future. The more you “procrastinate” on a task by doing +1 actions in favor of tomorrow, the more momentum you build, making it easier to TEND or AFFIRM in the future.

## Context

This Axiom transforms personal growth from a pass/fail system into a graceful, self-correcting one. It establishes a minimum floor of progress that is always achievable. Winning is not a prerequisite; consistent Tending is. The true game is not in the score, but in the Ternary state of continuous, non-zero progress.
