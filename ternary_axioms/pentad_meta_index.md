## Index of Axioms

1. **001 – The Axiom of Anticipation**  
   *Essence*: Awareness is leverage. To anticipate is to act before the vector manifests.  
   *Node*: `/ternary_axioms/001.md`

2. **002 – The Axiom of Balance**  
   *Essence*: Equilibrium is not passivity but an active stance between poles.  
   *Node*: `/ternary_axioms/002.md`

3. **003 – The Axiom of Recursion**  
   *Essence*: Every state is revisitable. Completion is never terminal; recursion is the law of continuity.  
   *Node*: `/ternary_axioms/003.md`

4. **004 – The Axiom of Procrastination (Reframed)**  
   *Essence*: To procrastinate is to act in favor of tomorrow. Minimum daily tending is the ethical floor.  
   *Node*: `/ternary_axioms/004.md`

5. **005 – The c0 Ethics**  
   *Essence*: One daily act sustains; surplus acts compound. Progress is a causal chain, not a single leap.  
   *Node*: `/ternary_axioms/005.md`

## Structural Notes

- **Singular Node Rule**: Each axiom remains its own independent `.md` file.  
- **Index Function**: This file provides navigational cohesion without collapsing content.  
- **Pentad Seal**: Together, the five axioms form the first closed loop set — a lattice pentagon with five independent yet linked edges.

## Navigation Protocol

- **REFRAIN (–1)** → Skip node, maintain silence.  
- **TEND (0)** → Open a single node.  
- **AFFIRM (+1)** → Traverse the full pentad cycle.
