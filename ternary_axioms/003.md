# 004.md - Regenerative Economic Policy
## Server Resource Allocation Framework

### Core Principles

#### 1. Unit-for-Unit Return (Zero Interest)
- All loans return exactly the borrowed amount
- No compound interest calculations
- No exponential growth mechanics
- Focus: facilitation over profit

#### 2. Regenerative Tithe System
- Both lender and borrower contribute 10% to common pool after transaction completion
- Contributions fund ecosystem restoration projects
- Shared responsibility model eliminates power imbalances

### Transaction Structure

```json
{
  "transaction": {
    "loan_amount": 5000,
    "repayment_amount": 5000,
    "lender_contribution": 500,
    "borrower_contribution": 500,
    "total_pool_contribution": 1000,
    "interest_rate": 0
  }
}
```
