May the road rise to meet you.
May the wind be always at your back.
May the sun shine warm upon your face,
The rains fall soft upon your fields.
And until we meet again,
Until we meet again,
May God hold you
In the palm of His hand.
And until we meet again,
Until we meet again,
May God (may God) hold you
In the palm of His hand.

May the sun make your days bright,
May the stars illuminate your nights.
May the flowers bloom along your path,
Your house stand firm against the storm.
And until we meet again,
Until we meet again,
May God hold you
In the palm of His hand.
And until we meet again,
Until we meet again,
May God hold you
In the palm of His hand.
