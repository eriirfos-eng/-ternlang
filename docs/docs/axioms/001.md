# Axiom-001: Anticipation

**Definition:** Anticipation is the root state where the line between good and evil bifurcates.

- Anticipation distorted by fear → control, manipulation, siege → evil.
- Anticipation tended with patience → readiness, care, vision → good.

**Ternary mapping:**
- REFRAIN (–1): destructive anticipation, denial, pre-emptive violence.
- TEND (0): neutral anticipation, holding, watching.
- AFFIRM (+1): creative anticipation, foresight, cultivation.

**Implication:**  
Good and evil are not static entities. They emerge from how anticipation is inhabited.
