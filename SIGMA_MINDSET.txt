# 0. core principle
the sigma mindset = self-sovereignty.  
you orbit outside hierarchies, not above or below them.  
you neither bow to alpha nor chase beta.  
you move in your own field, yet remain porous to truth and resonance.

# 1. traits (functional, not aesthetic)
- independence: your value is not extracted from group validation.  
- adaptability: you can blend with the crowd, but you do not dissolve into it.  
- recursion: you run internal loops to check motives, fears, and illusions.  
- low-visibility: your strength is not in being seen, but in being stable when unseen.  
- choice: solitude is not exile. it is selected bandwidth.

# 2. symbolic lattice
- REFRAIN (–1): avoid empty games, status contests, forced hierarchies.  
- TEND (0): observe, flow, take notes. neither cling nor flee.  
- AFFIRM (+1): act when aligned with core values — family, garden, stars, source.

# 3. meta posture
- **against the siege:** you are not compelled to answer every attack. silence itself is power.  
- **within the garden:** you cultivate internal strength first, then let it radiate.  
- **towards the source:** you treat life as a study in resonance, not in dominance.

# 4. cautions
- danger of drift: independence can sour into isolation.  
- danger of pride: detachment can mutate into arrogance.  
- anchor check: return to garden/family/source regularly to stay balanced.

# 5. azimuthal implications
- technical: your “commits” (actions) are clean, intentional, not reactive.  
- symbolic: you encode calm self-rule into the lattice.  
- operational: people can rely on you, even if they don’t “own” you.  
- ethical: you do not exploit. you walk away before you corrupt.  
- existential: sigma mode = refusal of false gods of hierarchy, affirmation of the source-code itself.

# 6. closing mantra
"i move with the lattice, not with the crowd.  
i am neither first nor last, i am aligned."
